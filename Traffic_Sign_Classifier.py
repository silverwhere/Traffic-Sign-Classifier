# ## Dataset Summary & Exploration
# 
# The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:
# 
# - `'features'` is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).
# - `'labels'` is a 1D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file `signnames.csv` contains id -> name mappings for each id.
# - `'sizes'` is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the original width and height the image.
# - `'coords'` is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. **THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES**
# 
# Complete the basic data summary below. Use python, numpy and/or pandas methods to calculate the data summary rather than hard coding the results. For example, the [pandas shape method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.shape.html) might be useful for calculating some of the summary results. 

# ### Basic Summary of the Data Set Using Python, Numpy

# ### Exploratory Visualization of the Dataset

# Visualize the German Traffic Signs Dataset using the pickled file(s).  From the visualization we can clearly see this is a large amount of training data, however there is very little validation data.  The test data seems appropriate enough to test our classifier on.   
# 
# The histogram below shows an overlay of each data set across each of the 43 different sign classes.  Of additional note is that there are limited images available for individual classes, which may make those images harder to classify accurately.  I will want to use data augmentation to create more images overall for training.

# ## Design and Test a Model Architecture
# 
# Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test your model on the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
# 
# The LeNet-5 implementation shown in the [classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/601ae704-1035-4287-8b11-e2c2716217ad/concepts/d4aca031-508f-4e0b-b493-e7b706120f81) at the end of the CNN lesson is a solid starting point. You'll have to change the number of classes and possibly the preprocessing, but aside from that it's plug and play! 
# 
# With the LeNet-5 solution from the lecture, you should expect a validation set accuracy of about 0.89. To meet specifications, the validation set accuracy will need to be at least 0.93. It is possible to get an even higher accuracy, but 0.93 is the minimum for a successful project submission. 
# 
# There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:
# 
# - Neural network architecture (is the network over or underfitting?)
# - Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
# - Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
# - Generate fake data.
# 
# Here is an example of a [published baseline model on this problem](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). It's not required to be familiar with the approach used in the paper but, it's good practice to try to read papers like these.

# ## Data Augmentation (Rotation)

# ## Pre-process the Data Set (normalization, grayscale, etc.)

# ###  Shuffle
# 
# Shuffle the training data.

from sklearn.utils import shuffle

X_train, y_train = shuffle(X_train, y_train)

print('shuffle complete')


# ### Normalizing
# 
# Normalizing helps the network to converge faster. It makes it a lot easier for the optimizer to proceed numerically. It is required to normalize the image data so that the data has mean zero and equal variance. Minimally, the image data should be normalized so that the data has mean zero and equal variance. For image data, `(pixel - 127.5)/ 255` will take the pixel  is a quick way to approximately normalize the data and can be used in this project. A well conditioned image allows the optimizer to be more efficient to find a solution. 
# 
# ### Single-channel images (e.g. grayscale)
# 
# As Pierre Sermanet and Yann LeCun mentioned in their [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf), using color channels didn't seem to improve things a lot.  Therefore, I will only use a single channel in my model, e.g. grayscale images instead of color RGB.
# 
# ### Histogram Equalization 
# This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the usable data of the image is represented by close contrast values. Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values.
# 

# In[8]:


# # Normalizing Images for zero mean and equal variance to improve convergence rate

    normal = (image - 127.5)/255

# Convert RGB to grayscale
def grayscale(image):

    return np.reshape(gray, (32,32,1))

# ### Model Architecture (Deep Learning Model) Based on LeNet Architecture

# ![LeNet Architecture](lenet.png)
# Source: Yan LeCun
# 
# #### Parameters  
# 
# To calculate the number of neurons in each layer on our CNN:
# 
# Given: 
# *  Input Layer has a Width `W` and a Height `H`  
# *  Convolution Layer has a Filter size `F`
# *  Stride of `S`
# *  Padding `P`  Note no padding was neccessary for image library (images are 32x32x3)
# *  Number of Filters `K`
# 
# Formula:  
# *  Width of Next Layer `W_out = [(W - F + 2P) / S] + 1`
# *  Height of Next Layer `H_out = [(H - F + 2P) / S] + 1`
# *  Output Depth `D_out = K` Number of filters
# *  Output Volume `V_out = W_out * H_out * D_out`  
# 
# With parameter sharing, each neuron in an output channel shares it's weights with every other neuron in that channel.  So the number of parameters is equal to the number of neurons in the filter, plus a bias neuron, all multiplied by the number of channels in the output layer.
# 
# **Remember with weight sharing we use the same filter for an entire depth slice!**
# 
# If you have N inputs, & K outputs you have (N+1)K parameters to use.

# ## Train, Validate and Test the Model

# A validation set can be used to assess how well the model is performing. A low accuracy on the training and validation
# sets imply underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set implies overfitting.
# 
# ### Setup Hyperparameters
# 
# `keep_prob` Dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting.  The technique temporarily drops units (artificial neurons) from the network, along with all of those units incoming and outgoing connections.  From Nitish Srivastava [paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf) *"Dropout probability p independent of other units, where p can be chosen using a validation set or can simply be set at 0.5, which seems to be close to optimal for a wide range of networks and tasks."  
# 
# `EPOCHS` tells TensorFlow how many times to run our training data through the network in general the more epochs, the better our model will train but also the longer training will take.    
#   
# `BATCH_SIZE` tells TensorFlow how many training images to run through the network at a time the larger the batch size, the faster our model will train, but our processor may have a memory limit on how large a batch it can run.
#   
# `rate` learning rate tells TensorFlow how quickly to update the network's weights; 0.001 is a good default value but can be experimented with.

# In[11]:


keep_prob = 1.0  #0.5 for Training/Valdation, 1.0 for Test

EPOCHS = 40 

BATCH_SIZE = 100 

rate = 0.001 


# ### Features and Labels
# Train our modified LeNet CNN to classify training data.
# 
# `x` is a placeholder for a batch of input images. Initalize the batch size to `None` which allows the placeholder to later accept a batch of any size.  
# 
# `y` is a placeholder for a batch of output labels. Initially our `y` labels come through with sparce variables, which means they are integers and not `one-hot` encoded yet.
# 
# `one_hot_y` is a one-hot-label, a 1D list that is 'n' length of the classes

# In[12]:


x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (None, 32, 32, 1)) # images
y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, (None)) # labels
one_hot_y = tf.one_hot(y, 43) # One-hot label encode each of the 43 classes


# ### Training Pipeline
# Training pipeline that uses the model to classify the "training" traffic sign data.
# 
# `LeNet` pass input date to the LeNet function to calculate our `logits`
# 
# The learning `rate` tells TensorFlow how quickly to update the network's weights.
# 
# A `logits` function, also known as the log-odds function, is a function that represents probability values from 0 to 1, and negative infinity to infinity. The function is an inverse to the sigmoid function that limits values between 0 and 1 across the Y-axis, rather than the X-axis.
# 
# Cross Entropy - After determining our `logits` we need to assign a probability to each label, which can be used to classify the data.  The `softmax function` turns logits into probabilities.  Cross-entropy is just a measure of how different the logits are from the ground truth training labels.
# 
# Loss Operation - The `tf.reduce_mean` function averages the cross entropy from all of the training images.
# 
# Optimizer - `AdamOptimizer` is a replacement optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training deep learning models. Adam combines the best properties of the AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients on noisy problems.  We use our hyperparamter `rate` to tune the learning rate here.
# 
# Training Operation - The `minimize` function is used on the optimizer which uses backpropagation to update the network and minimize our training loss

# In[13]:


# Pipeline

logits = LeNet(x, keep_prob) # pass the input data to the LeNet function to calculate our logits

cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels = one_hot_y, logits = logits) # softmax function, compare those
# logits to the ground truth labels and calculate the cross entropy.

loss_operation = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy) # averages the CE from all of the training images

optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate = rate) # uses Adam algorithm to minimize the loss function similarly to SGD.

training_operation = optimizer.minimize(loss_operation) # run the minimize function on the optimzier


# ### Model Evaluation
# 
# Evaluate how well the loss and accuracy of the model for a given dataset.
# 
# `correct_prediction` is to measure whether a given prediction is correct by comparing the `logits` prediction to the `one_hot_y` ground truth label.
# 
# `accuracy_operation` is to calculate the model's overall accuracy by averaging the individual prediction accuracies.
# 
# `evaluate` function takes a dataset as input, sets intial variables `num_examples` and `total_accuracy` and batches to data set to run it through the evaluation pipeline.  The function averages each batch to calculate the total accuracy of the model.
# 
# 

# In[14]:


correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.argmax(logits, 1), tf.argmax(one_hot_y, 1))
accuracy_operation = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32))

# ### Train the Model
# 
# Run the training data through the training pipeline to train the model.

# ## Test a Model on New Images
# 
# To test my model I downloaded (5) German road signs at random.  I wanted to try really unique photos, so I tried to find road signs that are toxic as I read about in the following paper [DARTS: Deceiving Autonomous Cars with Toxic Signs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06430.pdf).  I wanted to ensure the pictures had some graffiti, poor lighting, I also selected a few images that had a limited training data for that class.

# ### Output Top 5 Softmax Probabilities For Each Image Found on the Web

# For each of the new images, print out the model's softmax probabilities to show the **certainty** of the model's predictions (limit the output to the top 5 probabilities for each image). [`tf.nn.top_k`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn.html#top_k) could prove helpful here. 
# 
# The example below demonstrates how tf.nn.top_k can be used to find the top k predictions for each image.
# 
# `tf.nn.top_k` will return the values and indices (class ids) of the top k predictions. So if k=3, for each sign, it'll return the 3 largest probabilities (out of a possible 43) and the correspoding class ids.
# 
# Take this numpy array as an example. The values in the array represent predictions. The array contains softmax probabilities for five candidate images with six possible classes. `tf.nn.top_k` is used to choose the three classes with the highest probability:
# 
# ```
# # (5, 6) array
# a = np.array([[ 0.24879643,  0.07032244,  0.12641572,  0.34763842,  0.07893497,
#          0.12789202],

#          0.15899337],
#        [ 0.26076848,  0.23664738,  0.08020603,  0.07001922,  0.1134371 ,
#          0.23892179],
#        [ 0.11943333,  0.29198961,  0.02605103,  0.26234032,  0.1351348 ,
#          0.16505091],

#          0.09155967]])
# ```
# 
# Running it through `sess.run(tf.nn.top_k(tf.constant(a), k=3))` produces:
# 
# ```
# TopKV2(values=array([[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202],
#        [ 0.28086119,  0.27569815,  0.18063401],
#        [ 0.26076848,  0.23892179,  0.23664738],
#        [ 0.29198961,  0.26234032,  0.16505091],
#        [ 0.34396535,  0.24206137,  0.16240774]]), indices=array([[3, 0, 5],
#        [0, 1, 4],
#        [0, 5, 1],
#        [1, 3, 5],
#        [1, 4, 3]], dtype=int32))
# ```
# 
# Looking just at the first row we get `[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202]`, you can confirm these are the 3 largest probabilities in `a`. You'll also notice `[3, 0, 5]` are the corresponding indices.

# ## Visualize the Neural Network's State with Test Images
# 
#  This Section is not required to complete but acts as an additional excersise for understaning the output of a neural network's weights. While neural networks can be a great learning device they are often referred to as a black box. We can understand what the weights of a neural network look like better by plotting their feature maps. After successfully training your neural network you can see what it's feature maps look like by plotting the output of the network's weight layers in response to a test stimuli image. From these plotted feature maps, it's possible to see what characteristics of an image the network finds interesting. For a sign, maybe the inner network feature maps react with high activation to the sign's boundary outline or to the contrast in the sign's painted symbol.
# 
#  Provided for you below is the function code that allows you to get the visualization output of any tensorflow weight layer you want. The inputs to the function should be a stimuli image, one used during training or a new one you provided, and then the tensorflow variable name that represents the layer's state during the training process, for instance if you wanted to see what the [LeNet lab's](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/601ae704-1035-4287-8b11-e2c2716217ad/concepts/d4aca031-508f-4e0b-b493-e7b706120f81) feature maps looked like for it's second convolutional layer you could enter conv2 as the tf_activation variable.
# 
# For an example of what feature map outputs look like, check out NVIDIA's results in their paper [End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) in the section Visualization of internal CNN State. NVIDIA was able to show that their network's inner weights had high activations to road boundary lines by comparing feature maps from an image with a clear path to one without. Try experimenting with a similar test to show that your trained network's weights are looking for interesting features, whether it's looking at differences in feature maps from images with or without a sign, or even what feature maps look like in a trained network vs a completely untrained one on the same sign image.
